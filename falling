<h1>&lt;marquee&gt;&nbsp;Heyyyy la I&#39;m driving to u as fast as I can...</h1>

<pre>
&lt;marquee&gt; <span style="color:#FF8C00;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;"><kbd><span class="marker">Theres heaps of roadkill on the Hume I keep thinking about how far it is from a body of water and that if it wasn&rsquo;t and uh I was like a bit stronger in like stomach and arms maybe id carry all these kangaroo bodies and dump them in the water. It&#39;s just too harsh to die here the wind and the sun.</span></kbd></span></span></span></pre>

<p><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">&lt;marquee&gt;&nbsp;they&rsquo;ve been dragged from the road to the dirt on the side and u can see these marks from where there would be missing fur. I hope they&rsquo;re not cold. I think at least they deserve the sound of underwater and not the road. You deserve that too. You should always be able to hear under the water in your favourite place to swim.<img alt="heart" height="23" src="https://www.quackit.com/html/online-html-editor/ckeditor/ckeditor_4.4.1_full/plugins/smiley/images/heart.png" title="heart" width="23" /> &lt;marquee&gt;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><span style="font-size:12px;">&lt;marquee&gt;&nbsp;I love those days when like it doesn&rsquo;t matter if were in Albury or like fucking Kohl we haveeeee to find a place to swim. It&#39;s your scorpio moon and my scorpio rising it doesn&rsquo;t matter where we are we just have to find a place to get wet.&nbsp;&lt;marquee&gt;</span></span></span></p>
